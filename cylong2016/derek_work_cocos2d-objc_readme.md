Cocos2D-SpriteBuilder
=====================

[Cocos2D-SpriteBuilder][1] is a framework for building 2D games, demos, and other
graphical/interactive applications for iOS, Mac and Android.
It is based on the [Cocos2D][2] design, but instead of using Python it uses Swift or Objective-C.

Cocos2D-SpriteBuilder is:

  * Fast
  * Free
  * Easy to use
  * Community Supported


Creating New Projects
---------------------

New Cocos2D projects are created with SpriteBuilder. SpriteBuilder is, just like Cocos2D, free and open source. You can get SpriteBuilder from [spritebuilder.com](http://u.720life.cn/g/7b742d044a3bf38d5494940ac8ddb5f11a7f98e28f217d81e0905f1f42265b2b) or from the Mac App Store. Projects created using SpriteBuilder contains the complete Cocos2D source code, and after the project has been created using SpriteBuilder is optional.

SpriteBuilder also allows you to update the Cocos2D version in your project, to newest version, making it trivial to always keep your project updated to latest Cocos2D version.

You can find the full Cocos2D documentation and user guide at our [documentation page](http://u.720life.cn/g/5672b300e9438a4c59db5b3101a9c8e7df511cfa66f825e7878d32cad86c06d26721b1baee134a823deb5bd18885bac5).
