3. Design philosophy of ZenTao Project Management Software
==========================================================

The main management philosophy of ZenTao Project Management Software is based on Scrum, an internationally popular agile management methodology. Scrum is very pragmatic and easy to operate, so it fits in the fast iterative software development projects. However, Scrum only defines the core management framework. There are still many details and processes that need to be extended and developed. Based on the philosophy of Scrum and the observation of the current R&D situation in China, ZenTao integrates bug management, test case management, release management and document management, and it covers the entire life cycle of software R&D. In ZenTao, the concept of product, project and test is clearly defined. Product team, development team and testing team coordinate and check with each other while they function differently. The three teams interact with each other through working on stories, tasks and bugs, and eventually deliver the product with quality.
