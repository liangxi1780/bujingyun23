REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://u.720life.cn/g/3f9c4b3c4d80694fc0e23fabd7c88654f0dfbfbb8ff28d57c1f1dcb475ae0c14), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://u.720life.cn/g/3f9c4b3c4d80694fc0e23fabd7c88654b71be0fd64449b0c1c4be1e7575c58edd7dbbdbbf369bc2fd444f04f073785df1cc67f4863ea06de2115714ee12fd8e8).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.2.0"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://u.720life.cn/g/8f5cdc432a060592456eb0cbdbcfdf34f6d4ec6378d37374ceb7ef8e7aaf947ff0e76cefee645482bec36f4a9b105788) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => ' ',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.



TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://u.720life.cn/g/02db3d395376e3c6aa57c30d0ad62f0e3c031e73a5f1e97c0762ad4c8374a98d).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
vendor/bin/codecept run
``` 

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser. 


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://u.720life.cn/g/423b6dd9f9bd8437d83be879d3229d5a32a050424c20fa8342fa8a482e758a4d9518133b2b81f6e60ad5b96b776cab0d) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ``` 

5. (Optional) Create `yii2_basic_tests` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/test_db.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
vendor/bin/codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
vendor/bin/codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
vendor/bin/codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
